      <p>Clinical trials evaluate drug safety and efficacy in humans. Phase I tests safety in healthy volunteers, Phase II assesses efficacy in patients, Phase III confirms effectiveness in larger populations, and Phase IV monitors post-marketing safety. Challenges include recruitment, cost, and regulatory compliance. Technologies include electronic data capture and adaptive trial designs. Example: COVID-19 vaccines underwent accelerated clinical trials with global collaboration.</p>
