      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The drug discovery pipeline is a complex and multidisciplinary process that transforms scientific research into life-saving medications. This knowledge base provides a comprehensive overview of each stage, from target identification to post-marketing surveillance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>History of Drug Discovery</h2>
      <p>Drug discovery has evolved from traditional herbal remedies to modern high-throughput screening and computational modeling. Milestones include the development of penicillin, the rise of synthetic chemistry, and the integration of genomics and proteomics in the 21st century.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Interdisciplinary Collaboration</h2>
      <p>Successful drug development requires collaboration among chemists, biologists, pharmacologists, data scientists, clinicians, and regulatory experts. Academic institutions, pharmaceutical companies, and government agencies work together to advance therapeutic innovation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Economic Impact</h2>
      <p>The pharmaceutical industry is a major contributor to global economies, generating billions in revenue and supporting millions of jobs. Drug development is costly and time-intensive, often exceeding $2 billion and 10 years per approved drug. However, the societal benefits are immense.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Future Directions</h2>
      <p>Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, CRISPR gene editing, and personalized medicine are reshaping the drug discovery landscape. Future efforts aim to reduce development time, improve safety, and address unmet medical needs worldwide.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ethical Considerations in Drug Discovery</h2>
      <p>Drug discovery must adhere to ethical standards, including informed consent, animal welfare, data integrity, and equitable access to treatments. Researchers must ensure transparency, avoid conflicts of interest, and prioritize patient safety throughout the development process.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Role of Regulatory Bodies</h2>
      <p>Regulatory agencies such as the FDA (U.S.), EMA (Europe), and CDSCO (India) oversee drug approval and safety. They establish guidelines for clinical trials, manufacturing practices, labeling, and post-market surveillance to protect public health and ensure efficacy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Patient-Centric Approaches</h2>
      <p>Modern drug discovery emphasizes patient-centricity by involving patients in trial design, considering quality-of-life outcomes, and tailoring therapies to individual needs. Personalized medicine and real-world evidence are key components of this paradigm shift.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Global Collaboration</h2>
      <p>International partnerships among academia, industry, and governments accelerate drug development. Initiatives like the WHO's Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator and global clinical trial networks exemplify the power of collaboration in addressing global health challenges.</p>
