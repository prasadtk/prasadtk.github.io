      <p>Hit discovery involves identifying small molecules or biologics that interact with the target. High-throughput screening (HTS), fragment-based screening, and computational methods like molecular docking are commonly used. Challenges include false positives and low hit rates. Technologies include robotic screening platforms and AI-driven virtual screening. Example: HTS led to the discovery of HIV protease inhibitors, revolutionizing AIDS treatment.</p>
