      <p>Lead optimization refines hit compounds to enhance potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetics while reducing toxicity. Medicinal chemistry, structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, and ADMET profiling are key methodologies. Challenges include balancing efficacy and safety. Technologies include computational modeling and automated synthesis. Example: Optimization of imatinib led to its success in treating chronic myeloid leukemia.</p>
