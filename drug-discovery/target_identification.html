      <p>Target identification is the first step in drug discovery, involving the selection of biological molecules such as proteins, genes, or RNA that are implicated in disease mechanisms. Techniques include genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics. Challenges include validating targets and understanding disease pathways. Technologies like CRISPR and RNAi are used for functional genomics studies. Example: Identifying EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer led to targeted therapies like gefitinib.</p>
