      <p>Preclinical development assesses the safety and biological activity of lead compounds in vitro and in vivo. Studies include pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and efficacy in animal models. Challenges include species differences and predictive accuracy. Technologies include organ-on-chip systems and imaging modalities. Example: Preclinical studies of pembrolizumab demonstrated immune checkpoint inhibition, leading to clinical trials.</p>
