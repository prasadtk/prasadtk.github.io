                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is an innovative method that relies on the known three-dimensional structure of a biological target. By visualizing the shape and atomic arrangement of the protein or enzyme, scientists can rationally design and synthesize molecules that will fit perfectly into its binding pocket.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-700 mb-2">2. Role of Structural Biology</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    The foundation of SBDD is obtaining the high-resolution 3D structure of the target molecule. This is primarily achieved through advanced techniques such as **X-ray Crystallography**, **Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM)**, and **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy**. These methods provide the blueprint for drug design.

                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    SBDD utilizes powerful computational methods, also known as virtual screening, to efficiently search vast chemical libraries. Instead of physical screening, these methods use computer simulations to predict which molecules are most likely to bind to the target, saving significant time and resources.

                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    A core computational technique in SBDD is **molecular docking**. This process computationally simulates how a small molecule (a potential drug) will bind and orient itself within the 3D structure of the target protein. This helps predict binding affinity and guides the design of better molecules.

                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    With the structural data, chemists can rationally design a new molecule from scratch or modify an existing one. This is an iterative process of **design, synthesis, and testing**, where each new compound is a carefully calculated improvement on the last, based on how it is expected to interact with the target.

                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    SBDD significantly increases the efficiency and success rate of drug discovery. It allows researchers to design novel chemical structures, optimize binding interactions with greater precision, and create higher-quality lead compounds with fewer trial-and-error steps.
