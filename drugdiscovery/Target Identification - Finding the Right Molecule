    <h1>Target Identification: Finding the Right Molecule</h1>

    <p><strong>Target identification</strong> is the foundational step in drug discovery. This process involves identifying a biological molecule, such as a protein, enzyme, or gene, that plays a crucial role in a disease. A well-chosen and validated target is the key to creating a drug that is both safe and effective.</p>

    <h2>Methods of Target Identification:</h2>
    <p>Target identification is the process of pinpointing a biological target linked to a specific disease. Researchers use a variety of techniques to find these targets.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Genetic Approaches:</strong> Studying human genetic data to find genes associated with a disease. For example, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) can identify genetic variations that increase the risk of a disease, pointing to a potential therapeutic target.</li>
        <li><strong>Biochemical and Proteomic Approaches:</strong> Analyzing the proteins involved in disease pathways. Techniques like mass spectrometry can identify proteins that are over- or under-expressed in a diseased state compared to a healthy one.</li>
        <li><strong>Computational Methods:</strong> Using bioinformatics and machine learning to analyze large datasets of genomic and proteomic information. These "in silico" methods can predict novel targets based on their interaction networks and functional roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Literature and Hypothesis-Driven Research:</strong> Leveraging existing scientific knowledge and published research to formulate hypotheses about a targetâ€™s role in a disease.</li>
    </ul>
